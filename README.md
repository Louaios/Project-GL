# Project-GL
A repository for our project concerning creation of a web directory for algerian lawyers [To modify later]
A lawyer web directory is a website that lists lawyers in a region or country. It usually provides basic information about lawyers, such as their names, contact details, areas of specialization, etc. Some directories may also provide more detailed information, such as client reviews, articles written by the attorney, or links to the attorney's personal website.
Web lawyer directories are a useful tool for people looking for a lawyer. They make it quick and easy to find a lawyer in a given region, specializing in a particular area. They can also be used to compare lawyers and their prices. Lawyer web directories are generally free for users. Lawyers, on the other hand, generally pay a fee to be listed there.
